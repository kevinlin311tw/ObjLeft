Abandoned Object Detection via Temporal Consistency Modeling and Back-Tracing Verification for Visual Surveillance

Created by Kevin Lin, Shen-Chi Chen, Chu-Song Chen, Daw-Tung Lin, Yi-Ping Hung at National Taiwan University.


## Introduction

This paper presents an effective approach for detecting abandoned luggage in surveillance videos. We combine short- and long-term background models to extract foreground objects, where each pixel in an input image is classified as a 2-bit code. Subsequently, we introduce a framework to identify static foreground regions based on the temporal transition of code patterns, and to determine whether the candidate regions contain abandoned objects by analyzing the back-traced trajectories of luggage owners. Experimental results show that our method performs more favorable against the others.

The details can be found in the following [IEEE TIFS 2015 paper](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~r01944012/TIFS15_LIN.pdf)
